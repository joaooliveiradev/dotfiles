# Craft — Implement

**Goal**: Implement ONE task at a time. Surgical changes. Verify. Commit. Repeat.

This is where code gets written. Every task follows the same cycle: pick → state plan → RED → GREEN → verify → commit.

---

## MANDATORY: Before Starting Any Implementation

**Read [coding-principles.md](../../references/coding-principles.md) and state:**

1. **Assumptions** - What am I assuming? Any uncertainty?
2. **Files to touch** - List ONLY files this task requires
3. **Success criteria** - How will I verify this works?

**Also read every `.md` file in `.craft/standards/`** (if the folder exists and is non-empty). These are framework/library idioms for this project's stack (e.g., React Router v7, Tailwind) — apply them when writing code. If the folder is missing or empty, skip silently.

⚠️ **Do not proceed without stating these explicitly.**

---

## Process

**Sub-agent context:** When this task is executed by a sub-agent, the sub-agent receives
the task definition, coding principles, standards from `.craft/standards/*.md` (if present),
TESTING.md, and relevant spec/design context.
All steps below apply identically whether running in the main context or a sub-agent.
The only difference: sub-agents report results back to the orchestrator rather than
continuing to the next task.

### 1 — Read the active slug from STATE.md

Read `.craft/project/STATE.md` → `Current Feature`. That is the active slug.

- If it is `none` or missing → **stop** and tell the user:
  > "No active feature found. Run `/craft feature` first."
- Print the resolved slug so the user sees what's active.

Open the feature folder at `.craft/features/[slug]/`. `tasks.md` must exist there — if not, stop and tell the user to run `/craft tasks` first.

### 2. Pick Task

From tasks.md (if exists) or from the execution plan above. User specifies ("implement T3") or suggest next available.

### 3. Verify Dependencies

If tasks.md exists, check dependencies. If using inline plan, follow the order listed.

❌ If blocked: "T3 depends on T2 which isn't done. Should I do T2 first?"

### 4. State Implementation Plan

Before writing code:

```
Files: [list]
Approach: [brief description]
Success: [how to verify]
```

### 5. Write Tests First (RED)

If the task includes tests (per the Tests field in tasks.md or TESTING.md coverage matrix):

1. Write the test file(s) BEFORE writing any implementation
2. Tests must encode the expected behavior from the task's "Done when" criteria
3. Run the test command — confirm tests FAIL (RED state)
4. If tests pass before implementation exists, the tests are too weak — rewrite them


**Constraints:**

- Tests define correct behavior independently of implementation
- Each acceptance criterion from "Done when" maps to at least one test assertion
- Edge cases from spec.md that apply to this task get test cases too

If the task does NOT include tests (e.g., entity-only, config-only), skip to Step 5b.

### 5b. Implement (GREEN)

Write the minimum implementation needed to satisfy the task's success criteria: pass all relevant tests (when present) and meet the defined verification/gate checks when there are no direct tests.

**HARD CONSTRAINTS:**

- Do NOT modify tests written in Step 5. The tests are the spec — implementation conforms to them.
- Do NOT weaken assertions (making them less specific to pass more easily)
- Do NOT delete or skip test cases
- Do NOT use the test framework's skip/disable/pending mechanism to bypass failing tests
- Minimum code to pass — save structural improvements for a refactor task

If a test is genuinely wrong (tests the wrong behavior per spec), STOP and ask the user
before modifying it. Never silently change a test.

Follow [coding-principles.md](../../references/coding-principles.md):

- Simplest code that works
- Touch ONLY listed files
- No scope creep

### 6. Gate Check (VERIFY)

Run the gate check command from the task definition. This is MANDATORY — not "if applicable."

1. Look up the command for the task's Gate level (quick/full/build) in TESTING.md's Gate Check Commands section, then run it
2. Non-zero exit code = STOP. Fix the failure. Re-run. Do not proceed until green.
3. Confirm the test count matches expectations (no tests were silently deleted or skipped)

**Tiered gates (from TESTING.md Gate Check Commands):**

| Task includes                    | Gate level | What runs                |
| -------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| Unit tests only                  | Quick      | Unit test command        |
| E2E or integration tests         | Full       | Unit + E2E commands      |
| Last task in a phase             | Build      | Build + lint + all tests |
| No tests (config, entities, etc) | Build      | Build + lint only        |

The gate check is deterministic. The test runner decides if the code is correct,
not the agent's self-assessment.

### 7. Post-Gate Review

After the gate check passes:

1. Verify test count: Are there at least as many test cases as before? (prevents silent deletion)
2. Verify no SPEC_DEVIATION: If implementation diverged from spec/design, add a marker:

```
// SPEC_DEVIATION: [what diverged]
// Reason: [why the deviation was necessary]
```

3. Quick complexity check: "Would senior engineer flag this as overcomplicated?"
   - Yes → Simplify, re-run gate
   - No → Proceed to commit

### 8. Atomic Git Commit

Each task gets its own commit immediately after verification. Never batch multiple tasks into one commit.

**Format ([Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)):**

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**

| Type       | When to use                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature or capability                               |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                                 |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                                      |
| `test`     | Adding or correcting tests                              |
| `style`    | Formatting, missing semicolons, etc. (no code change)   |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                                 |
| `build`    | Build system or external dependencies                   |
| `ci`       | CI configuration files and scripts                      |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks that don't modify src or test files   |

**Scope:** Feature name or module area, lowercase, e.g., `auth`, `cart`, `api`

**Description rules:**

- Imperative mood ("add", not "added" or "adds")
- Lowercase first letter
- No period at the end
- Complete the sentence: "If applied, this commit will _[your description]_"

**Breaking changes:** Append `!` after type/scope AND add `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:

```
feat(api)!: change authentication endpoint response format

BREAKING CHANGE: login endpoint now returns JWT in body instead of cookie
```

**Examples:**

```
feat(auth): add email validation to login form
```

```
fix(cart): prevent negative quantity on item decrement
```

```
refactor(api): extract token refresh logic into service

Move token refresh from inline handler to dedicated AuthTokenService
for reuse across multiple endpoints.
```

**Rules:**

- One task = one commit
- Description references what was DONE, not what was planned
- Include only files listed in the task — never sneak in "while I'm here" changes
- If tests are part of the task, include them in the same commit

### 9. Scope Guardrail

During implementation, you will notice things that could be improved, refactored, or added. **Do not act on them.** Instead:

- If it's a bug: note it in STATE.md as a blocker or use quick mode
- If it's an improvement: note it in STATE.md under "Deferred Ideas" or "Lessons Learned"
- If it's related to the current task: only include it if it's in the "Done when" criteria

**The heuristic:** "Is this in my task definition?" If no, don't touch it.

### 10. Update Task Status

Mark task complete in tasks.md. Update requirement traceability in spec.md

### 11. Phase Handoff

After updating task status, check whether **all tasks** in `tasks.md` are now complete.

- **Not all complete** → loop back to Step 2 with the next task.
- **All complete** → ask: *"All tasks complete. Can I call Review now? (y/n)"*. `yes` → invoke `workflow/review/review.md` with the resolved slug. Anything else → stop. The user resumes later with `Start review`.

## Execution Template

[Write minimum code to pass tests]

- Tests modified: None
- Tests skipped/deleted: None

### VERIFY: Gate Check

- Command: [gate check command]
- Result: [X passed, 0 failed]
- Test count: [N — matches RED phase count]

### Post-Gate

- [x] No SPEC_DEVIATION (or markers added)
- [x] No unnecessary changes made
- [x] Matches existing patterns

**Status**: ✅ Complete | ❌ Blocked | ⚠️ Partial
```

## Tips

- **One task at a time** — Focus prevents errors
- **Tools matter** — Wrong MCP = wrong approach
- **Reuses save tokens** — Copy patterns, don't reinvent
- **Check before commit** — Verify all criteria, then commit
- **Stay surgical** — Touch only what's necessary
- **Commit per task** — Clean git history enables bisect and rollback
- **Never "while I'm here"** — Scope creep during implementation is the #1 quality killer
- **Learn from mistakes** — If something goes wrong, add a Lesson Learned to STATE.md
